## The MAPME Initiative

**MAPME** (Measuring and Advancing the Protection of Ecosystems) is an initiative that develops open-source tools and methodologies for conservation monitoring and impact evaluation.

### Goals

1. **Reproducible Analysis**: Create transparent, reproducible workflows for processing global biodiversity and environmental data
2. **Open Tools**: Develop open-source R packages that enable anyone to analyze conservation effectiveness
3. **Evidence-Based Conservation**: Support data-driven decision making in protected area management

### Partners

- **KfW Development Bank**: Financial cooperation projects for protected areas worldwide
- **GIZ**: Technical cooperation and capacity building
- **Academic Partners**: Collaboration on methodology development and validation

## The mapme.biodiversity Package

The [mapme.biodiversity](https://github.com/mapme-initiative/mapme.biodiversity) R package is the technical foundation for these analyses. It provides:

- **Resource Functions**: Download and manage global environmental datasets
- **Indicator Functions**: Calculate standardized indicators for any polygon geometry
- **Efficient Processing**: Parallel computation support for large portfolios
- **Standardized Output**: Consistent data formats across all indicators

### Supported Indicators

The package supports numerous indicators including:

- Forest cover and forest loss (Global Forest Watch)
- Burned areas (MODIS MCD64A1)
- Landcover classification (ESA WorldCover)
- Population density (WorldPop)
- Climate variables (CHELSA, WorldClim)
- And many more...

## Data Sources

### Global Forest Watch

Forest cover data from Hansen et al. (2013) provides:

- **Tree Cover 2000**: Baseline forest extent
- **Year of Loss**: Annual forest loss detection (2001-present)
- **Resolution**: 30m Landsat-derived

> Hansen, M. C., et al. (2013). High-Resolution Global Maps of 21st-Century Forest Cover Change. *Science*, 342(6160), 850-853.

### MODIS Burned Area (MCD64A1)

The MCD64A1 product provides:

- **Burned Area**: Monthly burned area detection
- **Burn Date**: Julian day of burning
- **Resolution**: 500m MODIS-derived

> Giglio, L., et al. (2018). The Collection 6 MODIS burned area mapping algorithm and product. *Remote Sensing of Environment*, 217, 72-85.

### World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA)

Protected area boundaries from UNEP-WCMC and IUCN:

- **Polygons**: Official protected area boundaries
- **Attributes**: Governance, management, IUCN category
- **Updates**: Monthly data releases

> UNEP-WCMC and IUCN (2024), Protected Planet: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA).
