The  routines in this repository for calculating forest cover loss and fires based on MODIS are now working and the data is processed. Now I would like you to focus on the analysis part. I want you to 

- update t threat_assessment_bolivia and make all plots pretty
- check the results and your text interpretation in the report against the actual data.

There might be different ways to do check for consistency. You could either 
- check the results from the raw data generated and stored in the csvs and analyse this data yourself to draw  conclusions or
- render the report and analyse either the html or a screenshot of the rendered html report, or
- approach this in any other way that seems effective to you. Reflect on how to best approach this. You are the data analyst in this cases and your interpretations should be in line with the empirical data. 

What I need you to do specifically is: 
- confirm, that the text interpretation in the report is in line with your observations from the data patterns
- draw further conclusions from the data that do not appear in the text yet. These can be general trends, highlighting examples with a larger explanatory power for general patterns, pointing to outliers or other observations that deviate from general trends.
