## Welcome

This website hosts threat assessment reports and conservation analyses for protected areas worldwide. The analyses leverage open geospatial data and the [mapme.biodiversity](https://github.com/mapme-initiative/mapme.biodiversity) R package to generate reproducible insights on ecosystem health and conservation pressures.

## Data Sources

Our analyses rely on globally consistent, openly available datasets:

| Dataset | Source | Resolution |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Forest Cover | Global Forest Watch (Hansen et al., 2013) | 30m |
| Burned Areas | MODIS MCD64A1 | 500m |
| Protected Areas | WDPA/IUCN | Vector |

## Methodology

The reports in this repository use the **mapme.biodiversity** R package, which provides:

- Standardized access to global environmental datasets
- Efficient zonal statistics computation
- Reproducible indicator calculations
- Support for parallel processing
