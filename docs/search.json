    "text": "Forest Cover Loss (2000-2024)\nForest cover loss is quantified using Global Forest Watch data (Hansen et al., 2013). Forest cover loss is defined as “a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state.” Loss can result from human activities or natural factors such as droughts, forest fires, or hurricanes.\n\nKey Indicators\nWe focus on two primary outcome indicators:\n\nTotal forest cover loss: Measures the cumulative loss area in hectares. This identifies PAs with the highest primary forest cover loss, useful for targeting areas where we might achieve the largest impact in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.\nRelative forest cover loss: Measures the percentage of primary forest cover lost compared to the total primary forest area in 2000. PAs with high relative losses may have lost large parts of their functional forest habitat, making them priorities for protecting floral biodiversity, fauna, and dependent human communities.\n\n\n\nInteractive Map\nThe map below depicts relative and absolute forest cover loss in the selected areas. Circle size indicates total loss (larger = more loss), and color indicates relative loss (red = higher percentage lost). From a threat perspective, large red circles indicate especially relevant areas for conservation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute Forest Cover Loss\nThe lollipop plot below ranks protected areas by total forest cover loss (2000-2024). Areas supported by KfW projects are highlighted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Forest Cover Loss Trends\nThe heatmap below shows annual forest cover loss trends for each protected area. Green indicates low loss, red indicates high loss. This visualization helps identify:\n\nSudden large loss events (potential natural disasters or land clearing)\nContinuous loss patterns (ongoing anthropogenic conversion)",

    "text": "Interpretation & Discussion\n\nMost Threatened Protected Areas\nBased on the combined analysis of forest cover loss and burned area data, the following protected areas emerge as the most threatened and should be prioritized for conservation intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThreat Index Methodology\n\n\n\nThe Composite Threat Index used in this analysis follows established approaches in conservation prioritization (Margules and Pressey 2000; Wilson et al. 2005). The index combines three normalized indicators:\n\nAbsolute Forest Loss (ha): Total hectares of forest lost since 2001, capturing the magnitude of habitat destruction.\nRelative Forest Loss (%): Percentage of original forest cover lost, indicating the intensity of pressure relative to the area’s forest resources.\nTotal Burned Area (ha): Cumulative fire exposure since 2015, reflecting fire-related threats.\n\nCalculation Method: Each indicator is normalized to a 0-1 scale using min-max normalization: ( = ). The final threat score is the arithmetic mean of all three normalized indicators, giving equal weight to each threat dimension.\nInterpretation:\n\nScores close to 1.0 indicate areas with the highest combined threats across all dimensions\nScores close to 0.0 indicate areas with relatively lower threat levels\nThe index is relative to the analyzed portfolio and should not be compared across different study areas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningCritical Findings: Most Threatened Areas\n\n\n\nBased on the composite threat index and supporting evidence from documented fire events:\n1. Otuquis National Park - Ranks among the highest-threat areas due to catastrophic fire events during the 2019-2020 Bolivian fire crisis. According to reports from the Fundación Amigos de la Naturaleza (Fundación Amigos de la Naturaleza (FAN) 2019), this Pantanal-Chaco transition zone experienced unprecedented fire activity that burned over 5 million hectares across eastern Bolivia in 2019 alone.\n2. San Matías Integrated Management Natural Area - High burned area and forest loss values. This area, located near the Brazilian border in the Chiquitano dry forest region, was severely affected by the 2019 fires, which were linked to agricultural expansion and land clearing practices.\n3. Areas in the Chiquitano Dry Forest Region - The Chiquitano forest, the world’s largest and best-preserved tropical dry forest, experienced devastating fires in 2019 that destroyed approximately 1.4 million hectares according to satellite analysis. Several protected areas in this region show elevated threat scores.\n4. Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park - While showing high absolute values due to its large size (3.4 million ha), this area appears to have been relatively spared from the worst fire events. Note that GFW detection limitations in dry forest ecosystems (see methodology note above) may underestimate actual forest dynamics in this area.\nNote on Data Interpretation: The rankings are based on available satellite data and should be interpreted alongside ground-truth information and local ecological knowledge. Some areas may show low threat scores due to detection limitations rather than actual low threat levels.\n\n\n\n\nDoes Forest Cover Loss Coincide with High Burned Areas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis reveals a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.67) between absolute forest cover loss and burned area. This relationship suggests that fire and deforestation are interconnected threats in many protected areas. Key observations:\n\nHigh fire, high loss areas (upper right quadrant): These areas experience fire-driven deforestation, where fire is likely a direct cause or facilitator of forest loss. They should be prioritized for integrated fire management and deforestation control.\nHigh fire, low loss areas (upper left quadrant): These may represent ecosystems where fire occurs but does not lead to permanent forest loss—either because fires occur in non-forest vegetation (savannas, grasslands) or because forests regenerate after fire events.\nLow fire, high loss areas (lower right quadrant): Deforestation in these areas is driven by factors other than fire, such as agricultural conversion or logging. Different intervention strategies focused on land-use planning and enforcement may be more effective.\nAreas near the origin: Protected areas with low values for both metrics may either be well-protected or, in the case of dry forest ecosystems, may be affected by the detection limitations discussed above.\n\n\n\nIs KfW Already Present in the Most Threatened Areas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKfW Portfolio Coverage Analysis\n\n\n\nCurrent KfW presence in threatened areas:\n\nOf the top 10 most threatened protected areas, 1 are currently supported by KfW projects.\nThis indicates that KfW is underrepresented in the most critical areas requiring conservation investment.\n\nCoverage by threat level:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal Patterns and Emerging Threats\nThe heatmaps reveal important temporal patterns that align with documented events in the region:\n\n2019-2020 Fire Crisis: Multiple protected areas show dramatic spikes in both burned area and forest loss during 2019-2020. This corresponds to the well-documented Bolivian fire crisis of 2019, during which fires—many linked to agricultural clearing—burned an estimated 5.3 million hectares across Bolivia (Fundación Amigos de la Naturaleza (FAN) 2019). The Chiquitano dry forest, the world’s largest and best-preserved tropical dry forest (Pennington, Prado, and Pendry 2000), was particularly affected, with approximately 1.4 million hectares burned. International media and conservation organizations extensively documented this event, which triggered national emergency declarations.\nPost-Crisis Patterns (2020-2023): Following the 2019 peak, some areas show reduced fire activity. This may reflect:\n\nReduced fuel availability after extensive burning\nIncreased monitoring and enforcement following international attention\nNatural variation in fire occurrence\nHowever, 2020 also saw significant fire activity in the Pantanal region, affecting areas like Otuquis National Park\n\nPersistent Deforestation Patterns: Areas showing continuous, steady loss patterns (rather than fire-related spikes) suggest ongoing land conversion pressures, likely related to agricultural expansion—a pattern consistent with Bolivia’s agricultural frontier dynamics in the lowlands.",

    "text": "Code\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this new project is to update a data-analysis that was done with R. The data-analysis was done about 2 years ago and I downloaded the repo for you that contains the relevant code. You can find and scan the code in this folder: “~/Documents/cursor/mapme.protectedareas/”. You may not need to scan everything because it will crowd your context window but you should start with\n-       “~/Documents/cursor/mapme.protectedareas/README.md” -       “~/Documents/cursor/mapme.protectedareas/contributing.md”\nTo get a first impression how the repo is structured and about its multiple purposes. You will see that it has mulitple purposes of which only a couple is relevant here.\nYou can then check the file “~/Documents/cursor/mapme.protectedareas/analysis/threat_assessment_bolivia.Rmd”.\nIt contains the relevant reporting code that I need to update. You will notice that in this script, several datasets are loaded for the analysis. I will provide you with newly updated data here or tell you how to generate it.\nThe R object that is called “wdpa_kfw” is now located under “data/portfolio.gpkg”. It contains all protected areas that are still or where formerly financed by KfW or GIZ.\nNext there is an R object created called “gfw_lossstats” loaded from a CSV. this file contains forest cover loss statistics from the global forest watch. It was generated with another script using the mapme.biodiversity package. You can find more information about this package here and about its basic usage here https://github.com/mapme-initiative/mapme.biodiversity. Read the readme.md from the repository to understand how it works. You should then create a separate R script from scratch called “processing.R” that generates the relevant input statistics. We do this outside of the Rmd script, because it can take a longer time to process.\nHere the update already starts. You should add data up until 2024 i.e. process forest cover loss data between 2000 and 2024.\nA more detailed documentation of the package is also available online under: https://mapme-initiative.github.io/mapme.biodiversity/\nThe same is true for fire data. later in the script there is an object loaded called bolivia_fire_data. This data was also generated with the afformentioned package which also allows to calculate fire indicators. Now there is one important change in the package. Formerly the package allowed to generated statistics on active fire counts using NASA FIRMS data. Now the package only allows to generate burned areas in ha based on MODIS data. So you would also need to update the analysis code in the markdown file to account for this and measure area instead of incidences.\n You will also need another geospatial datafile that contains all protected areas. It is used in the script to create an object called wdpa_allPAs. You can find the relevant data in “data/wdpa.gdb”. Its a file geodatabase, that you can load as a spatial layer in R as well.\nNow here are your main tasks for the project - regenerate and update the relevant input data for the period 2000-2024. Do this in a sepearte R script. process the data and eventually fix errors. - regenerate the rmd file for reporting purposes. Note that you should adapt the text in the markdown according to the new study period, utilized methods and data and also according to the results you detected. - You should check before, whether we still want to use the old RMD system or whether it is possible to change to the more modern Quarto format from RStudio. - check whether it still makes sense to use workflowR to generate the website or whether it is easier to use Quarto for this purpose. Remember that I use Github pages the free version. I want to make this a scalable project i.e. to put new analysis scripts and reports into the website. - generate the html websites for from the RMD or Quarto files so I can check the results.\n Make sure to install and or update also all relevant R packages. Also make sure to generate sufficient documentation in a Readme file of this repo."

It is important to understand the methodological differences between burned area and forest cover loss data:\n\nBurned Area (MCD64A1): Cumulative sum of all fire-affected areas. If the same area burns multiple times over the analysis period, each burn event is counted separately. This means burned area totals can exceed the total land area of a protected area.\nForest Cover Loss (Global Forest Watch): Each forest pixel is only counted once when it transitions from forest to non-forest. Even if an area burns multiple times or experiences repeated disturbances, the loss is recorded only at the initial deforestation event.\n\nImplication for interpretation: Burned area values are typically higher than forest cover loss values because they represent cumulative fire exposure, not permanent land cover change. High burned area with low forest loss may indicate recurrent fires in grasslands or savannas, while matching high values in both metrics suggest fire-driven deforestation.\n\n\nFire is a significant threat to protected areas, whether from natural causes (e.g., El Niño-related droughts) or human activities (land clearing, agricultural burning). The MODIS MCD64A1 burned area product provides monthly burned area detection at 500m resolution, allowing us to quantify the total hectares affected by fire within each protected area over the analysis period (2015-2022).\n\nInteractive Map\nThe map shows burned area totals for analyzed protected areas.

It is important to understand the methodological differences between burned area and forest cover loss data:\n\nBurned Area (MCD64A1): Cumulative sum of all fire-affected areas. If the same area burns multiple times over the analysis period, each burn event is counted separately. This means burned area totals can exceed the total land area of a protected area.\nForest Cover Loss (Global Forest Watch): Each forest pixel is only counted once when it transitions from forest to non-forest. Even if an area burns multiple times or experiences repeated disturbances, the loss is recorded only at the initial deforestation event.\n\nImplication for interpretation: Burned area values are typically higher than forest cover loss values because they represent cumulative fire exposure, not permanent land cover change. High burned area with low forest loss may indicate recurrent fires in grasslands or savannas, while matching high values in both metrics suggest fire-driven deforestation.\n\n\nGFW Detection Limitations in Dry Forest Ecosystems\nA critical limitation of the Global Forest Watch data concerns its reduced detection accuracy in dry forest ecosystems, such as those found in Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and other Chaco-type environments. This limitation stems from several technical factors:\n\nSpectral Confusion: The “brown” signature of deciduous trees during the dry season is often indistinguishable from bare soil in global satellite baselines, leading to underdetection of forest cover.\nDeciduous Phenology: Dry forests naturally lose their leaves seasonally, which can be misinterpreted as permanent forest loss or, conversely, cause actual losses to be missed when trees are leafless.\nAlgorithm Bias: Research indicates that GFW algorithms are fundamentally optimized for humid tropical biomes and frequently misclassify the sparse, clumped canopies characteristic of the Gran Chaco as shrubland or non-forest.\nMasking Practices: GFW often masks out non-humid regions from its primary forest datasets entirely, resulting in systematic underrepresentation of dry forest dynamics.\n\nInterpretation Guidance: Low or zero forest cover loss values for dry forest protected areas (such as Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco) should be interpreted as a technical artifact rather than evidence of low threat. Nevertheless, the relatively low burned area values observed in Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco suggest that this area may indeed have been spared from the major fire events that affected other regions in the last decade.\n\n\n\n\nFire is a significant threat to protected areas, whether from natural causes (e.g., El Niño-related droughts) or human activities (land clearing, agricultural burning). The MODIS MCD64A1 burned area product provides monthly burned area detection at 500m resolution, allowing us to quantify the total hectares affected by fire within each protected area over the analysis period (2015-2023).\n\nInteractive Map\nThe map shows burned area totals for analyzed protected areas. Larger circles indicate greater cumulative burned area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Burned Area by Protected Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Burned Area Trends",

    "text": "Recommendations for Conservation Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipImportant Caveat\n\n\n\nThis analysis examines conservation priorities exclusively through the lens of environmental threats (forest loss and fire). A comprehensive project prioritization would also need to consider:\n\nBiodiversity values: Species richness, endemism, and ecological uniqueness\nSocioeconomic factors: Local livelihoods, economic development needs, and poverty contexts\nSocial and cultural dimensions: Indigenous territories, traditional land use, and community perspectives\nInstitutional capacity: Existing management structures, governance quality, and implementation feasibility\n\nThe recommendations below should therefore be understood as one input among many for investment decisions, highlighting areas where threat mitigation interventions may be most urgent from a forest conservation perspective.\n\n\nBased on the findings of this analysis, we suggest the following priorities:\nPriority 1 — Target High-Threat Areas The protected areas with the highest composite threat scores should be prioritized for conservation intervention. This includes areas experiencing both high absolute forest loss and significant fire exposure. Among these, areas not currently receiving KfW support represent potential opportunities for new investments to expand coverage of the most threatened sites.\nPriority 2 — Invest in Fire Management Capacity The 2019-2020 fire crisis demonstrated the vulnerability of protected areas in the Chiquitano and Pantanal-Chaco transition zones to catastrophic fire events. Investments in fire prevention (fuel management, firebreak maintenance), early detection systems, and rapid response capacity could significantly reduce future losses in these ecosystems.\nPriority 3 — Strengthen Monitoring for Verification Given the detection limitations of satellite-based monitoring in dry forest ecosystems (discussed in the Methods section), ground-based monitoring and the integration of alternative data sources (such as MapBiomas Chaco) should be considered to improve threat assessment accuracy in areas like Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco.",

    "text": "Discussion of Methods and Data\n\nForest Cover Loss Data (Global Forest Watch)\nThe GFW methodology defines forest cover loss as “a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state” (Hansen et al., 2013). Key interpretation considerations:\n\nDetection scope: GFW detects loss of tree cover ≥5m in height with ≥30% canopy cover, which may miss sparse or degraded forests\nCause attribution: GFW does not differentiate between natural and human-caused loss; sudden spikes may indicate wildfires or storms, while continuous patterns suggest agricultural conversion\nTemporal resolution: Annual data allows trend analysis but may miss within-year dynamics\nDry forest limitations: As noted above, GFW algorithms are optimized for humid tropical forests and systematically underdetect changes in dry and deciduous forest ecosystems\n\n\n\nBurned Area Data (MODIS MCD64A1)\nThe MODIS MCD64A1 burned area product (Giglio et al., 2018) provides monthly burned area detection at 500m resolution. Key considerations:\n\nSpatial accuracy: The 500m resolution captures the actual spatial extent of burned areas, not just fire detections\nEcosystem context: Fire impacts vary by ecosystem—savannas may tolerate and even depend on regular fire, while moist rainforests are highly fire-sensitive\nFire types: The product does not distinguish between natural fires, controlled burns, and fire used for land clearing\nCumulative counting: Unlike forest loss (counted once per pixel), burned area accumulates each time an area burns, so totals can exceed actual land area if recurrent fires occur\n\n\n\nComposite Threat Index Limitations\nThe threat index developed for this analysis provides a standardized comparison across protected areas but has inherent limitations:\n\nEqual weighting: The three indicators are weighted equally, though in some contexts one threat dimension may be more important than others\nRelative scoring: The index is relative to the analyzed portfolio; an area with a “low” score is only low relative to other areas in Bolivia\nDetection bias: Areas with systematically underdetected threats (e.g., dry forests) may appear artificially low-risk\n\n\n\nRecommendations for Future Analysis\n\nAlternative data sources: Integrate MapBiomas Chaco data to accurately capture dry forest dynamics and loss, addressing GFW’s detection limitations in the Gran Chaco region\nLand cover analysis: Overlay loss areas with land cover data to distinguish permanent agricultural conversion from natural disturbance and regeneration\nBuffer zone analysis: Examine threats in PA buffer zones and corridors, as edge pressures often drive internal degradation\nSpatial hotspot mapping: Create fine-resolution heatmaps within large PAs to identify specific threat frontiers\nTemporal baseline comparison: Compare recent fire patterns to historical norms (pre-2015) to contextualize current threat levels\nSocioeconomic drivers: Integrate data on agricultural commodity prices, land tenure, and road infrastructure to understand and predict deforestation drivers",
